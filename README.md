# discordjs-v12.5.3-selfbot-patch

Modified version of Discord.js v12.5.3 to allow usage of user accounts

I modified some of the source files so it will allow you to log in with a user token. 

WARNING:

Selfbotting is against Discord Terms of Service. I am not responsible if your account gets terminated 
(obviously)

I don't know what kind of errors my edits will cause, especially with sharding. 
If you encounter errors, please feel free submit it as an issue and I'll try to fix it.
(I love it) 

I might update this every time discord.js updates, not sure.

Requires node v12+ just like the official version.

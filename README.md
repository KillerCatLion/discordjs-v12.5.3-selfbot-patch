# discordjs-v12.5.3-selfbot-patch

<h3>Modified version of Discord.js v12.5.3 to allow usage of user accounts</h3>
I modified some of the source files so it will allow you to log in with a user token. 
<br>
<h4>I am now publishing this to an NPM package: </h4><i>KillerCatLion/DiscordJS-Patched-For-Selfbots</i>
<br>
<br>
WARNING:

<b>Selfbotting is against Discord Terms of Service. I am not responsible if your account gets terminated</b>
(obviously)

I don't know what kind of errors my edits will cause, especially with sharding. 
If you encounter errors, please feel free submit it as an issue and I'll try to fix it.
(I love it) 

I might update this every time discord.js updates, not sure.
Requires node v12+ just like the official version.

<br>
<h4>HOW TO INSTALL:</h4>
Install discord.js@12.5.3<br>
Download this repo as zip<br>
Extract folder "node_modules" to the folder that also has "node_modules"<br>
It should replace discord.js' origional files<br>
It should not replace any other packages


Again, any issues feel free to ask for help, I'm not an expert but I can try to help.

Thank you.
